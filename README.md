# Zillow Housing Hackathon: Wheeler

Wheeler brings wheelchair accessibility information forward. It's a version of Zillow optimized for the needs of people who use wheelchairs to get around. As it grows, Wheeler will push property owners to talk openly about compliance to ADA standards. [Github](http://github.com)

This application was developed on February 7th, 2015 for the [Zillow Housing Hackathon](http://www.geekwire.com/calendar-event/zillow-uw-host-hack-housing-empowering-smarter-decisions-weekend-hackathon/).

Our app is live at http://example.com/awesome-app-that-doesnt-exist. You can log in as the demo user "unicorns" with password "sartfarkles". You can also check out [this demo screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of our application on YouTube.

## Challenge and Approach

According to the US Census Bureau, 30.6 million people in the US have ambulatory disabilities. This application offers a better way to search for wheelchair accessible housing. As a result of Wheeler’s attention to accessibility details, we hope to see more property owners begin to comply with ADA standards.

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Research the needs and pain points people face when searching for accessible housing
- Create a persona to represent the user we want to serve
- Use recent housing accessibility data from the government
- Design a user interface optimized for filtering based on specific accessibility needs
- Deliver Zillow’s map resources in conjunction with precise housing search filters
